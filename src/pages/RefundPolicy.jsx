Please be informed that certain payment methods may attract additional processing fees that will be deducted from your account balance.

                    We trust our products so much that we 100% guarantee to refund your money either due to an error or mistake in the transaction or in case you end up having to lose any of our Ludo Vijayta contests solely because of technical problems in our Ludo vijayta's mobile applications. We however will need sufficient evidence from you to investigate the issue, upon investigation if it is proved that the error/issue is technical we'll refund you. Since we strive to make our product the best, we might ask questions to gather your feedback on the error and reproduce the same. Please make sure to provide a valid payment method with sufficient details for us to process your refund. The onus of providing accurate/valid bank/credit/debit card details is with you. We'll provide you with the refund transaction and reference number thereof in an email sent to you shortly after the refund transaction is successfully submitted at our end. Please allow 48 hours to receive the refund, in case you still have not received the refund, please contact us immediately. Only the entry fee of the contest deducted from your wallet/account will be refunded but not the total estimated winning amount of the contest under the assumption that the requested user has the highest probability of winning the contest, therefore the maximum refund will be your entry fee deducted from your wallet.
